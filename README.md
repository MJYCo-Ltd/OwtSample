Conference sample
----

## How to run conference sample

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Edit `samplertcservice.js`. Find `icsREST.API.init`, replace service ID, service key and REST server URL with the correct values.
3. Copy your SSL server certificate to cert/certificate.pfx.
4. Run `initcert.js` to generate a keystore file which contains encrypted SSL server's passphase.
5. Run `node samplertcservice.js` to start conference sample. By default, it listens on port 3001(insecure) and 3004(secure).
6. Open a browser and navigate to http://hostname:3001/ or https://hostname:3004/.

## QUIC

`public\scripts\quic.js` was added to create QUIC connections between client and server. After navigating to https://hostname:3004/quic.html?publish=false, the page automatically creates a `SendStream` for publishing. It also listens to `stream-added` message and creates new `ReceiveStream` for subscribing. It doesn't subscribe streams published before joining. Please try to modify `quic.js` if you want to try other QUIC features.
